# About tasks.json :
- This 'tasks.json' file is a configuration for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) that automates compiling and running C++ programs. It uses 'g++' with the 'C++17' standard to compile the current file and then executes it, reading input from 'input.txt' and writing output to 'output.txt'. To set it up, install VS Code, MinGW-w64 (and add it to PATH), and the C++ extension in VS Code. Create a .vscode folder in your project, add this file inside it, and prepare input.txt for program input. Press 'Ctrl+Shift+B' to compile and run your program, with the output saved in 'output.txt'.
